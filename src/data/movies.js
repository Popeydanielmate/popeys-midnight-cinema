    year: 1983,
    director: "James Sbardellati",
    cast: ["Rick Hill", "Barbi Benton", "Richard Brooker", "Lana Clarkson"],
    synopsis: "A lone warrior is tasked by a witch to find three magical artefacts — a sword, a chalice and an amulet — and must confront the evil sorcerer Munkar in a deadly tournament.",
    whyWatch: "A gloriously cheesy 80s sword-and-sorcery romp — perfect if you love campy practical effects, relentless action, and movies that never take themselves too seriously.",

    year: 1979,
    director: "Andrei Tarkovsky",
    cast: ["Alisa Freyndlikh", "Aleksandr Kaydanovskiy", "Anatoliy Solonitsyn",],
    synopsis: "A guide leads two men through an area known as the Zone to find a room that grants wishes.",
    whyWatch: "One of the most atmospheric and visually striking films ever made, immersing you in a mysterious, haunting world that feels almost alive. It’s philosophical without being pretentious, exploring universal themes like desire, purpose, and fear through mood rather than exposition. The film’s slow, deliberate pacing rewards attention, its imagery is unforgettable, and its emotional core is surprisingly powerful. It’s also hugely influential — shaping modern sci-fi, games, and filmmaking — making it a unique experience that lingers with you long after it ends.",

    coverPhoto: kaspar_modalcover,
    year: 1974,
    director: "Werner Herzog",
    cast: ["Bruno S", "Walter Ladengast", "Brigitte Mira",],
    synopsis: "Herzog's film is based upon the true and mysterious story of Kaspar Hauser, a young man who suddenly appeared in Nuremberg in 1828, barely able to talk or walk, and bearing a strange note; he later explained that he had been held captive in a dungeon of some sort for his entire life that he could remember, and only recently was he released, for reasons unknown. His benefactor attempts to integrate him into society, with intriguing results",
    whyWatch: "One of Werner Herzog’s most haunting and human films, telling the true story of a young man who spent his life in isolation and is suddenly thrust into society. Through Kaspar’s innocent, literal-minded view of the world, the film becomes a beautiful exploration of what it actually means to be “civilized,” how society treats outsiders, and how fragile and strange human behavior really is. Bruno S. gives a raw, unforgettable performance that feels almost documentary-real, and Herzog turns the story into something both philosophical and deeply emotional. It’s a film that stays simple on the surface but resonates long afterward.",

    year: 1977,
    director: "Werner Herzog",
    cast: ["Bruno S", "Eva Mattes", "Clemens Scheitz", "Wilhelm von Homburg", ],
    synopsis: "Bruno Stroszek is released from prison and warned to stop drinking. He has few skills and fewer expectations: with a glockenspiel and an accordion, he ekes out a living as a street musician. He befriends Eva, a sex worker down on her luck. After they are harried and beaten by the thugs who have been Eva's pimps, they join Bruno's neighbor, Scheitz, an elderly eccentric, when he leaves Germany to live in Wisconsin. In that winter bound, barren prairie, Bruno works as a mechanic, Eva as a waitress. They buy a trailer. Then, bills mount, the bank threatens to repossess the trailer, Eva wants privacy, and inexorably, the promise of a new life deserts Bruno.",
    whyWatch: "One of Herzog’s most heartbreaking yet darkly funny films, following a gentle, unlucky man who leaves Germany hoping for a better life in America, only to find a different kind of struggle. It blends bleak realism with surreal, poetic moments, creating a story that feels both painfully human and strangely dreamlike. Bruno S. gives another raw, vulnerable performance that makes the film emotionally gripping, and Herzog uses the American landscape to highlight the absurdities of modern life.",

    synopsis: "In 1983, a young mute woman with psychic abilities is held captive within the Arboria Institute, a secluded futuristic facility run by a sinister doctor with an unraveling mind and a growing obsession with her.",
    whyWatch: "Delivers a hypnotic, visually stunning blend of retro-sci-fi and psychological horror that feels unlike anything else. Rather than focusing on plot, it creates an intense, dreamlike mood through neon-soaked visuals, eerie synth music, and slow-burn tension. It’s a film that rewards viewers who enjoy atmosphere, symbolism, and unsettling, surreal imagery.",

    synopsis: "During an opulent banquet, eleven pampered guests participate in what appears to be a ritualistic gastronomic carnage. In this grotesque universe, an unexpected sequence of events destabilizes the endless symphony of abundance.",
    whyWatch: "Offers a striking early glimpse of Denis Villeneuve’s talent before he went on to make major films like Prisoners, Blade Runner 2049, and Dune. In just 12 minutes, he showcases the visual precision, atmospheric tension, and thematic depth that would define his later work, using a darkly surreal dinner scene to explore excess, repetition, and human appetite. The short is visually bold, sharply directed, and unsettling",

    year: 1987,
    director: "Clive Barker",
    cast: ["Ashley Laurence", "Andrew Robinson", "Clare Higgins", "Doug Bradley", ],
    synopsis: "Dark, atmospheric horror film about a man named Frank who opens a mysterious puzzle box that summons the Cenobites—otherworldly beings who blur the line between pain and pleasure. After Frank is torn apart, he’s partially resurrected in the attic of his brother’s house, depending on his former lover Julia to lure victims so he can rebuild his body. As his niece Kirsty uncovers the truth, she’s drawn into a deadly confrontation with both Frank and the Cenobites",
    whyWatch: "One of the most original and imaginative horror films ever made, blending supernatural mythology, visceral practical effects, and a twisted family drama into something that feels genuinely unsettling. Instead of relying on cheap scares, it builds a rich, disturbing world centered around desire, obsession, and the dangers of pushing past human limits. The Cenobites are iconic for a reason—they’re terrifying, mysterious, and unlike any other horror villains. A horror film that’s atmospheric, bold, and still shockingly unique decades later.",

    synopsis: "After a bad gambling bet, a schoolteacher is marooned in a town full of crazy, drunk, violent men who threaten to make him just as crazy, drunk, and violent.",
    whyWatch: "One of the most intense, haunting portrayals of psychological unraveling ever put on film, capturing the darker side of Australian outback culture with a realism that borders on nightmarish. Rather than relying on horror tropes, it traps you alongside its protagonist in a spiral of drinking, violence, peer pressure, and moral collapse, creating a sense of dread that feels disturbingly plausible. The film is beautifully shot, brilliantly acted, and still shockingly relevant, offering a raw look at masculinity, isolation, and the ease with which an ordinary person can lose control of their life. It’s a gripping, unforgettable experience",

    synopsis: "An American newcomer to a prestigious German ballet academy comes to realize that the school is a front for something sinister amid a series of grisly murders.",
    whyWatch: "A masterclass in surreal, nightmarish horror, combining vivid, expressionistic visuals, an unforgettable synth-heavy score, and a story that feels both mysterious and terrifying. Dario Argento turns a girls’ dance academy into a living nightmare, using color, lighting, and sound to create an atmosphere so intense it becomes almost tactile. Beyond the scares, it’s a deeply stylized, almost hypnotic experience that shows how horror can be both beautiful and horrifying at the same time.",

    synopsis: "In a nameless city deluged by continuous rain, three rabbits live with a fearful mystery.",
    whyWatch: "A surreal, unsettling experiment in atmosphere, dialogue, and timing that captures Lynch’s signature blend of dark humor and cosmic unease. Set in a sparse, dimly lit room with anthropomorphic characters, the short episodes use pauses, absurdist conversations, and eerie sound design to create a sense of dread and mystery that feels both mundane and nightmarish. It’s not a traditional story, but a hypnotic, haunting glimpse into Lynch’s exploration of isolation, anxiety, and the uncanny.",

    synopsis: "A single mother and her child fall into a deep well of paranoia when an eerie children's book titled Mister Babadook manifests in their home.",
    whyWatch: "A deeply psychological horror film that uses supernatural terror to explore grief, trauma, and the struggles of motherhood. Beyond the jump scares, it’s a tense, emotionally resonant story about a mother and her son confronting a mysterious, malevolent presence that mirrors their inner fears. The film combines atmospheric visuals, a haunting score, and a compelling central performance to create a horror experience that’s both terrifying and profoundly human.",

    whyWatch: "A slow, meditative science-fiction masterpiece that explores memory, grief, and the nature of human consciousness. Tarkovsky turns a space station orbiting a mysterious planet into a psychological and philosophical labyrinth, where the boundaries between reality and imagination blur. Unlike typical sci-fi, the film focuses on emotional and existential questions rather than spectacle, offering haunting imagery, long, immersive takes, and a profound sense of melancholy.",
